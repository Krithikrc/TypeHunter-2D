TypeHunter is a simple 2D typing game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The player must type the letters or words shown on the doors to move forward. If typed correctly, the door opens and the player enters safely. If the input is wrong or delayed, obstacles like a dragon, fire, or arrows appear and the game ends.

This project is designed as a fun way to practice typing speed while playing a game.
